# MacPicoVid Firmware Files
Compiled UF2 firmware files for Pi Pico boards used with the MacPicoVid project boards. Files built/compiled from:
https://github.com/guruthree/mac-se-video-converter

Files in this repo:
mac.uf2 - Stock file. This will put your MacPicoVid pi back to the original firmware with default options. 
macadjusted.uf2 - Horizontal adjustments for monitors that cut the image off to the left. I had this issue on an old dell monitor used for testing. May help you with the same issue with other brands.

Here is the specific MacPicoVid device I am using:
