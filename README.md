# MacPicoVidFirmware
Compiled MacPicoVid UF2 firmware files for Pi Pico boards.

I am providing a stock mac.uf2 file you can drag and drop to flash your Pi. This will put back the stock MacPicoVid firmware with default options. 

I ran into an issue where my new-ish dell monitor liked the stock vga video output. But my older dell monitor cut off the output drastically on the left. So far over you cannot adjust with the monitor buttons. The macadjusted.uf2 file has the changes in the code to fix that. It may help you with your non-dell monitor too.
